that would be good too like a "did you know" and C'tron face
there should be one with random quotes about the different art names around fire,ice,wave,lighting
like a command attack @name and it would said you attacked the person @X with blaze something something

and create a different lobby to pvp fight in discord
Or maybe the C'tron command could just be like a CrossCode advice thing where you ask him and he would give a game tip

and an actual HP bar

basically the idea is that you @the name of the guy and then the lea bot will be like: you attacked the person @something with the ability and that person lost % of hp

do a blushing lea pic
or the one holding the pillow
hugging it
that one is cute >w<
